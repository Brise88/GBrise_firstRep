<p>Nobody told me that the road would be EASY,

Believe ME.

With every BREATH,

I begin to feel one with DEATH.

Wondering why it’s not me lifeless in the GRAVE.

Wondering why my life is being SAVED?

The more I breathe in this world’s AIR,.

The more I seem to CARE.

The more than I APPRECIATE,

Every time I AWAKE. 

Every time I CRY,

Every fear I FACE,

I’m realizing I’m living NOW,

 for a purpose, while preparing MYSELF, 

for a better PLACE.

I do not know what tomorrow BRINGS,

But I know what today IS.



My tomorrow results from what I make of TODAY!

Today determines what my tomorrow may BRING!

Yesterday helps factors a fraction of my TODAY!



But nobody told ME!

The weight of the world would be carried by ME.

I knew it would be HARD,

but never did I think it would be this DIFFICULT.

I never thought I would actually loose so MUCH,

before I gain so LITTLE.

I never thought the little gain, would mean so MUCH!



I never realized how little I CRIED,

Until when I TRIED,

 		no tears would FLOW.

And when they started they would never STOP!

And when they stopped, the feelings would still REMAIN!





Nobody told me I would loose so many KEN.

Nobody told me I would loose several of my close FRIENDS.

Nobody told me I would feel so low DOWN.

Nobody told me I would be hurt by words SPOKEN.

Nobody told me my heart would be constantly BROKEN.



But even if they had told ME, 

all of this and much MORE.

It would have never prepared me to be the CHOSEN!<p><!--paragraph tag, holds block of text, and starts a new paragraph-->
